                For anyone else but those two, my identity may be of no interest,

                I once called myself Mello and was addressed by that name, but that was a long time ago.

            <p>Mello, whose real name is Mihael Keehl, is a prominent character in the "Death Note" series created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata.
                He was born on December 13, 1989, and grew up as an orphan at Wammy's House, a special institution established by Watari for gifted children.
                Mello, known for his intelligence and ambition, was one of the top candidates to succeed L, the world's greatest detective.
                Unlike Near, his calm and analytical rival, Mello had a more impulsive and aggressive personality.
                He chose to leave Wammy's House to pursue his own path in capturing Kira,
                the mysterious vigilante responsible for a global killing spree. Mello joined the mafia to gain resources and information,
                often resorting to extreme measures, including kidnappings and violence, to achieve his goals.
                Mello's most significant move was kidnapping Sayu Yagami, the daughter of Deputy Director Soichiro Yagami,
                to exchange her for the Death Note, a supernatural notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written in it.
                This bold act placed him in direct conflict with both Kira and Near, creating a complex power struggle.
                Despite his ruthless methods, Mello's actions ultimately contributed to exposing Kira's identity.
                His collaboration with Near, though strained, played a crucial role in bringing Kira to justice.
                Tragically, Mello's life was cut short when he was killed by the Shinigami Sidoh, who was manipulated by Kira.
                Mello's legacy is marked by his relentless pursuit of justice and his willingness to sacrifice everything to achieve his goals.
                His determination, intelligence, and courage remain memorable aspects of his character,
                making him an unforgettable figure in the "Death Note" series.
